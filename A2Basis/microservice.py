#Microservice objects describe pod information
#Microservice templates are created, from which microservice objects are created and associated with deployments.
#microserviceLabel is the identifying label of the microservice
#deploymentLabel is the label of the associated deployment. When intially created as a template, this is empty.
#currentReplicas are the current number of pod replicas for the microservice and deployment
#expectedReplics is the expected number of pod replicas
#handlingTime is the duration taken to handle requests
#cpuCost is the cost of deploying a microservice pod onto a node
